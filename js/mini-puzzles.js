/* Quill Mini puzzles. MINI EDITOR ONLY.
 *
 * Who can change this file is controlled by .github/CODEOWNERS.
 * The easiest way to make a puzzle is editor/mini.html: build the grid, write
 * the clues, and copy the finished entry into this list.
 *
 * Each puzzle:
 *   date:   optional "YYYY-MM-DD". A puzzle with today's date always wins.
 *           Puzzles without a date are used in rotation on any other day.
 *   grid:   5 rows of 5 characters. Letters for answers, "#" for black squares.
 *   across: [ANSWER, clue] for every across word (2+ letters), in any order.
 *   down:   [ANSWER, clue] for every down word, in any order.
 * Clue numbers are worked out from the grid automatically.
